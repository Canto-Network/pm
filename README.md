# Canto Project Management Repository

This repository is used for project management for various initiatives affecting the Canto protocol.

## Canto Protocol Improvement Cluster (CPIC) Meetings Overview

### Purpose

CPIC holds a bi-weekly meeting for the Canto development community to discuss technical issues and coordinate work on the Canto protocol. The meetings are attended by core contributors from various organizations. During the call, participants discuss potential protocol changes, testing and other related issues. 

The calls are saved on the [@CantoProtocol YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CantoProtocol). 

### Agendas

The agendas for calls are tracked in the Issues tab of this repository. To add an item to an agenda, please [open an issue in this repository](https://github.com/canto-network/pm/issues/new) which mentions the topic you want to discuss and links any relevant materials (CIPs, prototypes, etc.). Then, leave a comment in the agenda where you would like this to be discussed.

Anyone is welcome to add an item to the agenda as long as it follows these guidelines:

- The topic is technical in nature.
- The topic involves the Canto protocol at a low-level. This means Dapps and ERCs are generally not allowed as topics.
- The topic should not be philosophical. The core developer meetings are not meant to decide philosophical contentious issues that should be decided by the community. There are exceptions to this, but generally these topics distract from more productive technical discussion.

### Who Can Attend

Protocol developers, researchers and CIP authors are invited to attend the meetings.
